## About LiveShow

LiveShow is a development organization focused on creating and providing tools and resources for Minecraft game servers. Our goal is to simplify server management and configuration while offering innovative addons and features. We are also the developers of the LiveShow software, which will soon be available on Steam.

## What We Offer

### Preconfigured Servers

We provide preconfigured Minecraft servers with integrated Java. These servers are ready to use, allowing you to start your adventure quickly without the complexity of server setup.

### Innovative Interaction Software (Download here : [https://live-show.app/#/download](https://live-show.app/#/download))

- **Server Interaction**: Our LiveShow Software goes beyond traditional server management. It allows you to interact with your game servers in unique ways. For example, you can create actions that trigger in-game events when certain conditions are met outside the game. Want something special to happen in your server when you receive a like on TikTok or when you have a new Follower on Twitch? With LiveShow, it's possible! We empower you to bridge the gap between your online presence and your gaming world.
- **Immersive Sound Effects**: Elevate your live stream experience by playing customized sound effects in real-time when certain events occur. This adds a new layer of engagement for your audience.
- **Text-to-Speech Integration**: Transform viewer messages into spoken words, facilitating dynamic and interactive communication during your live sessions.
- **Simulated Keystrokes**: Trigger input keystrokes when specific events take place, enhancing your ability to interact with the game and your audience.
- **Minecraft Integration**: Take control in Minecraft with the ability to spawn mobs, change weather, or execute custom commands â€“ the possibilities are endless.
- **GTA 5**: Enjoy advanced functionality in GTA 5, including the ability to manage character actions, manipulate wanted levels, spawn vehicles, and much more.
- **Webhook Activation**: Easily trigger custom webhooks to expand the possibilities of your server interactions.
