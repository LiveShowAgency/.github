## About LiveShow Agency

LiveShow Agency is a development organization focused on creating and providing tools and resources for Minecraft game servers. Our goal is to simplify server management and configuration while offering innovative addons and features. We are also the developers of the LiveShow software, which will soon be available on Steam. Please note that LiveShow Software is not related to the "liveshow.com" website (a +18 website).

## What We Offer

### Preconfigured Servers

We provide preconfigured Minecraft servers with integrated Java. These servers are ready to use, allowing you to start your adventure quickly without the complexity of server setup.

### Innovative Interaction Software (Not out yet)

- **Server Interaction**: Our LiveShow Software goes beyond traditional server management. It allows you to interact with your game servers in unique ways. For example, you can create actions that trigger in-game events when certain conditions are met outside the game. Want something special to happen in your server when you receive a like on TikTok or when you have a new Follower on Twitch? With LiveShow, it's possible! We empower you to bridge the gap between your online presence and your gaming world.
- **Sound Effects**: Play custom sounds (when certain event happen) to enhance your stream and engage your audience in real-time.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Convert messages from viewers into speech, allowing for dynamic and interactive communication.
- **Keystrokes**: You can simulate Input Key (when certain event happen)
- **Minecraft Integration**: Spawn mobs, Change Weather, or just a custom command, you can do what you want.

### Promising Future

We are continually working on new and exciting features and resources to streamline game server management. Stay tuned as we plan to add even more items to our repository in the near future.
